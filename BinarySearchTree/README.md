Q-1 (Code: Search Node in BST) Given a BST and an integer k. Find if the integer k is present in given BST or not. Return the node with data k if it is present, return null otherwise. Assume that BST contains all unique elements.

Q-2 (Code: Print Elements in Range) Given a Binary Search Tree and two integers k1 and k2, find and print the elements which are in range k1 and k2 (both inclusive). Print the elements in increasing order.

Q-3 (Check if a Binary Tree is BST) Given a binary tree with N number of nodes, check if that input tree is BST (Binary Search Tree) or not. If yes, return true, return false otherwise. Duplicate elements should be in right subtree.

Q-4 (Code: Construct BST From Sorted Array) Given a sorted integer array A of size n which contains all unique elements. You need to construct a balanced BST from this input array. Return the root of constructed BST. Note : If array size is even, take first mid as root. 

Q-5 (Find Path in BST) Given a BST and an integer k. Find and return the path from the node with data k and root (if a node with data k is present in given BST). Return null otherwise. Assume that BST contains all unique elements.

Q-6 (Code: BST Class) Implement the BST class which includes following functions -
1. search
Given an element, find if that is present in BSt or not. Return true or false.
2. insert -
Given an element, insert that element in the BST at the correct position. Assume unique elements will be given.
3. delete -
Given an element, remove that element from the BST. If the element which is to be deleted has both children, replace that with the minimum element from right sub-tree.
4. printTree (recursive) -
Print the BST in ithe following format -
For printing a node with data N, you need to follow the exact format -
N:L:x,R:y
wherer, N is data of any node present in the binary tree. x and y are the values of left and right child of node N. Print the children only if it is not null.
There is no space in between.
You need to print all nodes in the recursive format in different lines.
Note : main function is given for your reference which we are using internally to test the class.

Q-7 Given a Binary Tree with N number of nodes, for each node create a new duplicate node, and insert that duplicate as left child of the original node. Note : Root will remain same. So you just need to insert nodes in the given Binary Tree and no need to print or return anything.

Q-8 (LCA of Binary Tree) Given a binary tree and two nodes, find LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) of the given two nodes in Binary Tree. Read about LCA if you are having doubts about the definition. If out of 2 nodes only one node is present, return that node. If both are not present, return -1.

Q-9 (LCA of BST) Given a binary search tree and two nodes, find LCA(Lowest Common Ancestor) of the given two nodes in the BST. Read about LCA if you are having doubts about the definition. If out of 2 nodes only one node is present, return that node. If both are not present, return -1.

Q-10 (Pair sum BInary Tree) Given a binary tree and an integer S, print all the pair of nodes whose sum equals S. Assume binary tree contains all unique elements. Note : In a pair, print the smaller element first. Order of different pair doesn't matter.

Q-11 (Path Sum Root to Leaf) Given a binary tree and a number k, print out all root to leaf paths where the sum of all nodes value is same as the given number k.

Q-12 (Largest BST) Given a Binary tree, find the largest BST subtree. That is, you need to find the BST with maximum height in the given binary tree. Return the height of largest BST.

Q-13 (Code: BST to Sorted LL) Given a BST, convert it into a sorted linked list. Return the head of LL.

Q-14 (Print nodes at distance k from node) Given a binary tree, a node and an integer K, print nodes which are at K distance from the the given node.

Q-15 (Pair sum in a BST) Given a binary search tree and an integer S, find pair of nodes in the BST which sum to S. You can use extra space only O(log n). Assume BST contains all unique elements. Note: In a pair, print the smaller element first.

Q-16 (Replace with Sum of greater nodes) Given a binary search tree, replace each nodes' data with the sum of all nodes' which are greater or equal than it. You need to include the current node's data also. That is, if in given BST there is a node with data 5, you need to replace it with sum of its data (i.e. 5) and all nodes whose data is greater than or equal to 5. You don't need to return or print, just change the data of each node.
