Q-1 (Print Tree Level Wise) Given a binary tree, print the tree in level wise order. For printing a node with data N, you need to follow the exact format - N:L:x,R:y wherer, N is data of any node present in the binary tree. x and y are the values of left and right child of node N. Print -1. if any child is null. There is no space in between. You need to print all nodes in the level order form in different lines.

Q-2 (Find Node) Given a Binary Tree and an integer x, check if node with data x is present in the input binary tree or not. Return true or false.

Q-3 (Height Of Binary Tree) Given a binary tree, find and return the height of given tree.

Q-4 (Mirror a Binary Tree) Mirror the given binary tree. That is, right child of every nodes should become left and left should become right.

Q-5 (Preorder Binary Tree) Given a binary tree, print the preorder traversal of given tree. Pre-order traversal is: Root LeftChild RightChild

Q-6 (Postorder Binary Tree) Given a binary tree, print the postorder traversal of given tree. Post-order traversal is: LeftChild RightChild Root

Q-7 (Construct Tree from Preorder and Inorder) Given Preorder and Inorder traversal of a binary tree, create the binary tree associated with the traversals.You just need to construct the tree and return the root. Note: Assume binary tree contains only unique elements.

Q-8 (Sum of all nodes) Given a binary tree, find and return the sum of all nodes.

Q-9 (Level order traversal) Given a binary tree, print the level order traversal. Make sure each level start in new line.

Q-10 (Remove Leaf nodes) Remove all leaf nodes from a given Binary Tree. Leaf nodes are those nodes, which don't have any children. Note : Root will also be a leaf node if it doesn't have left and right child. You don't need to print the tree, just remove all leaf nodes and return the updated root.

Q-11 (Nodes without sibling) Given a binary tree, print all nodes that donâ€™t have a sibling. Edit : Print the elements in different lines. And order of elements doesn't matter.

Q-12 (Construct Tree from Postorder and Inorder) Given Postorder and Inorder traversal of a binary tree, create the binary tree associated with the traversals.You just need to construct the tree and return the root. Note: Assume binary tree contains only unique elements.

Q-13 (ZigZag tree) Given a binary tree, print the zig zag order i.e print level 1 from left to right, level 2 from right to left and so on. This means odd levels should get printed from left to right and even level right to left.

Q-14 (is Balanced) Given a binary tree, check if its balanced i.e. depth of left and right subtrees of every node differ by at max 1. Return true if given binary tree is balanced, false otherwise.

Q-15 (Level wise linkedlist) Given a binary tree, write code to create a separate linked list for each level. You need to return the array which contains head of each level linked list.
