Q-1 (Print Tree Level Wise) Given a binary tree, print the tree in level wise order. For printing a node with data N, you need to follow the exact format - N:L:x,R:y wherer, N is data of any node present in the binary tree. x and y are the values of left and right child of node N. Print -1. if any child is null. There is no space in between. You need to print all nodes in the level order form in different lines.

Q-2 (Find Node) Given a Binary Tree and an integer x, check if node with data x is present in the input binary tree or not. Return true or false.

Q-3 (Height Of Binary Tree) Given a binary tree, find and return the height of given tree.

Q-4 (Mirror a Binary Tree) Mirror the given binary tree. That is, right child of every nodes should become left and left should become right.

Q-5 (Preorder Binary Tree) Given a binary tree, print the preorder traversal of given tree. Pre-order traversal is: Root LeftChild RightChild

Q-6 (Postorder Binary Tree) Given a binary tree, print the postorder traversal of given tree. Post-order traversal is: LeftChild RightChild Root

Q-7 (Construct Tree from Preorder and Inorder) Given Preorder and Inorder traversal of a binary tree, create the binary tree associated with the traversals.You just need to construct the tree and return the root. Note: Assume binary tree contains only unique elements.
