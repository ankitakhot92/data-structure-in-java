1. Given a linked list, find and return the length of input LL. Do it iteratively.

2. Given a linked list and a position i, print the node at ith position.
If position i is greater than length of LL, then don't print anything.
Indexing starts from 0.

3. (Delete Node in LL) Given a linked list and a position i, delete the node of ith position from Linked List iteratively.
If position i is greater than length of LL, then you should return the same LL without any change.
Indexing starts from 0. You don't need to print the elements, just delete the node and return the head of updated LL.

4. (Find a node in LL) Given a linked list and an integer n you need to find and return index where n is present in the LL. Do this iteratively.
Return -1 if n is not present in the LL.
Indexing of nodes starts from 0.

5. (AppendLastNToFirst) Given a linked list and an integer n, append the last n elements of the LL to front.
Indexing starts from 0. You don't need to print the elements, just update the elements and return the head of updated LL.
Assume given n will be smaller than length of LL.

6. (Eliminate duplicates from LL) Given a sorted linked list (elements are sorted in ascending order). Eliminate duplicates from the given LL, such that output LL contains only unique elements.
You don't need to print the elements, just remove duplicates and return the head of updated LL.

7. (Print reverse LinkedList) Print a given linked list in reverse order. You need to print the tail first and head last. You canâ€™t change any pointer in the linked list, just print it in reverse order.
