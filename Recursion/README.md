1. Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.

Constraints :
1 <= x <= 30
0 <= n <= 30

2. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to n in increasing order recursively. No need of write main function and returning anything. Assume code automically takes the input.

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10000 

3. Write a program that return the number of digits present in a number recursively. No need of writing main method.

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^6

4. Given an array of length N, you need to find and return the sum of all elements of the array.
Do this recursively.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3

5. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find if x is present in the array or not. Return true or false.
Do this recursively.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3

6. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the first index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
First index means, the index of first occurrence of x in the input array.
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3

7. Given two integers m & n, calculate and return their multiplication using recursion. You can only use subtraction and addition for your calculation. No other operators are allowed.

8. Given an integer n, count and return the number of zeros that are present in the given integer using recursion.

9. Given k, find the geometric sum i.e.
1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^k) 
using recursion. Return the answer.

10. Write a recursive function that returns the sum of the digits of a given integer.

11. Check if a given String S is palindrome or not (using recursion). Return true or false.

12. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

13. Given a string, compute recursively a new string where all appearances of "pi" have been replaced by "3.14".

14. Given a string, compute recursively a new string where all 'x' chars have been removed.

15. Write a recursive function to convert a given string into the number it represents. That is input will be a numeric string that contains only numbers, you need to convert the string into corresponding integer and return the answer.

16. Given a string, compute recursively a new string where identical chars that are adjacent in the original string are separated from each other by a "*".

17. Given an input string S and two characters c1 and c2, you need to replace every occurrence of character c1 with character c2 in the given string.
Do this recursively.

18. Given a string S, remove consecutive duplicates from it recursively.
Constraints :
1 <= Length of String S <= 10^3

19. A child is running up a staircase with N steps, and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up to the stairs. You need to return number of possible ways W.

(1 <= N <= 30)


20. Assume that the value of a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ... , z = 26. You are given a numeric string S. Write a program to print the list of all possible codes that can be generated from the given string.

Constraints :
1 <= Length of String S <= 10

21. Given an integer array (of length n), find and print all the subsets of input array.
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 15

22. Given a string S, find and return all the possible permutations of the input string.

23. Suppose you have a string made up of only 'a' and 'b'. Write a recursive function that checks if the string was generated using the following rules:
a. The string begins with an 'a'
b. Each 'a' is followed by nothing or an 'a' or "bb"
c. Each "bb" is followed by nothing or an 'a'
If all the rules are followed by the given string, return true otherwise return false.

24. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find all the indexes where x is present in the input array. Save all the indexes in an array (in increasing order).
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3
