1. Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.

Constraints :
1 <= x <= 30
0 <= n <= 30

2. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to n in increasing order recursively. No need of write main function and returning anything. Assume code automically takes the input.

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10000 

3. Write a program that return the number of digits present in a number recursively. No need of writing main method.

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^6
