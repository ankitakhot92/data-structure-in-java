1. Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.

Constraints :
1 <= x <= 30
0 <= n <= 30

2. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to n in increasing order recursively. No need of write main function and returning anything. Assume code automically takes the input.

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10000 

3. Write a program that return the number of digits present in a number recursively. No need of writing main method.

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^6

4. Given an array of length N, you need to find and return the sum of all elements of the array.
Do this recursively.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3

5. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find if x is present in the array or not. Return true or false.
Do this recursively.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3

6. Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the first index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
First index means, the index of first occurrence of x in the input array.
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^3

7. Given two integers m & n, calculate and return their multiplication using recursion. You can only use subtraction and addition for your calculation. No other operators are allowed.

8. Given an integer n, count and return the number of zeros that are present in the given integer using recursion.

9. Given k, find the geometric sum i.e.
1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^k) 
using recursion. Return the answer.

10. Write a recursive function that returns the sum of the digits of a given integer.

11. Check if a given String S is palindrome or not (using recursion). Return true or false.
