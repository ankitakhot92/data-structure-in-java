Q1. Implement Stack Using LL, with following funtions - size(), isEmpty(), top(), push(), pop() mainting time complexity O(1).

Q2. (Balanced Parenthesis) Given a string expression, check if brackets present in the expression are balanced or not. Brackets are balanced if the bracket which opens last, closes first. You need to return true if it is balanced, false otherwise.

Q3 (Check redundant brackets) Given a string mathematical expression, return true if redundant brackets are present in the expression. Brackets are redundant if there is nothing inside the bracket or more than one pair of brackets are present.
Assume the given string expression is balanced and contains only one type of bracket i.e. ().
Note: You will not get partial score for this problem. You will get marks only if all test cases are passed.

Q4 (Minimum bracket Reversal) Given a string expression which consists only ‘}’ and ‘{‘. The expression may not be balanced. You need to find the minimum number of bracket reversals which are required to make the expression balanced.
Return -1 if the given expression can't be balanced.
