1. Given an integer array of size 2N + 1. In this given array, N numbers are present twice and one number is present only once in the array.
You need to find and return that number which is unique in the array.
Note : Given array will always contain odd number of elements.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6

2. Given an array of integers of size n which contains numbers from 0 to n - 2. Each number is present at least once. That is, if n = 5, numbers from 0 to 3 is present in the given array at least once and one number is present twice. You need to find and return that duplicate number present in the array.
Assume, duplicate number is always present in the array.

Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^6

3. Given two random integer arrays, print their intersection. That is, print all the elements that are present in both the given arrays.
Input arrays can contain duplicate elements.

Constraints :
0 <= M, N <= 5 * 10^7

4. Given a random integer array of size n, write a function that rotates the given array by d elements (towards left)
Change in the input array itself. You don't need to return or print elements.

Constraints :
0 <= N <= 10^7
0 <= d <= N

5. Given an integer array, which is sorted (in increasing order) and has been rotated by some number k in clockwise direction. Find and return the k.

Constraints :
0 <= n <= 10^7

6. Given two string s and t, write a function to check if s contains all characters of t (in the same order as they are in string t).
Return true or false.
Do it recursively.

7. You have made a smartphone app and want to set its price such that the profit earned is maximised. There are certain buyers who will buy your app only if their budget is greater than or equal to your price.
You will be provided with a list of size N having budgets of buyers and you need to return the maximum profit that you can earn.
Lets say you decide that price of your app is Rs. x and there are N number of buyers. So maximum profit you can earn is :
 m * x
where m is total number of buyers whose budget is greater than or equal to x.

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6
