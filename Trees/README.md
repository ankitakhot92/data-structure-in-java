Q-1 (Print Level Wise) Given a generic tree, print the input tree in level wise order. That is, print the elements at same level in one line (separated by space). Print different levels in differnet lines.

Q-2 (Sum of nodes) Given a generic tree, count and return the sum of all nodes present in the given tree.

Q-3 (Number of nodes greater than x) Given a tree and an integer x, find and return number of Nodes which are greater than x.

Q-4 (Find Height) Given a generic tree, find and return the height of given tree.

Q-5 (Count leaf nodes) Given a generic tree, count and return the number of leaf nodes present in the given tree.

Q-6 (Post-order Traversal) Given a generic tree, print the post-order traversal of given tree. Post-order traversal is : Children and then Root

Q-7 (Check if generic tree contain element x) Given a generic tree and an integer x, check if x is present in the given tree or not. Return true if x is present, return false otherwise.

Q-8 (Node having sum of children and node is max) Given a tree, find and return the node for which sum of data of all children and the node itself is maximum. In the sum, data of node itself and data of immediate children is to be taken.

Q-9 (Structurally identical) Given two Generic trees, return true if they are structurally identical i.e. they are made of nodes with the same values arranged in the same way.

Q-10 (Next larger element) Given a generic tree and an integer n. Find and return the node with next larger element in the Tree i.e. find a node with value just greater than n. Return NULL if no node is present with value greater than n.

Q-11 (Count leaf Nodes) Given a generic tree, count and return the number of leaf nodes present in the given tree.

Q-12 (Replace node with depth) In a given Generic Tree, replace each node with its depth value. You need to just update the data of each node, no need to return or print anything.
